### The History of Dragon Boat Festival 历史

The Dragon Boat Festival was originally created by the ancestors of Wu and Yue in the south to worship the Dragon ancestor. It is said that Qu Yuan, a Chu poet in the Warring States period, committed suicide by jumping on the Miluo River on May 5. Later, people also took the Dragon Boat Festival as a festival to commemorate Qu Yuan. There are also some sayings to commemorate Wu Zixu, Cao E and Jie Zitui.

端午节，本是南方吴越先民创立用于拜祭龙祖的节日。因传说战国时期的楚国诗人屈原在五月五日跳汨罗江自尽，后来人们亦将端午节作为纪念屈原的节日；也有纪念伍子胥、曹娥及介子推等说法。

### Culture 习俗

##### Dragon Boat 划龙舟

Dragon boat rowing is an important activity of Dragon Boat Festival. It is a festival instrument of ancient dragon totem sacrifice, but also a relic. As early as 7000 years ago, ancient ancestors had canoes made of canoes and paddled them. Dragon boat was originally a canoe carved with dragon shape on a single wooden boat, and later developed into a dragon shaped boat made of wood.

划龙舟是端午节的一项重要活动，是古代龙图腾祭祀的节仪，乃遗俗也。早在7000年前，远古先民已用独木刳成木舟，并加上木桨划舟。龙舟最初是用单木舟上雕刻龙形的独木舟，后来发展为木板制作的龙形船。

##### Avoid five poisons 避五毒

Dragon Boat Festival in the ancient northern people's mind is poison day, evil day, in the folk this idea has been passed down, so there are all kinds of peace, avoid five poison customs. In fact, this is due to the hot and dry weather in the north in summer, people are easy to get sick and pestilence is also easy to spread; in addition, snakes and insects are easy to breed and bite people, which forms this habit.

端午在古代北方人心目中是毒日、恶日，在民间这个思想一直传了下来，所以才有种种求平安、避五毒的习俗。其实，这是由于北方夏季天气燥热，人易生病，瘟疫也易流行；加上蛇虫繁殖，易咬伤人，这才形成此习惯。

##### Tie five colored silk thread 拴五色丝线

In traditional Chinese culture, the five colors "green, red, white, black and yellow", which symbolize five directions and five elements, are regarded as auspicious colors. The Dragon Boat Festival was once a very popular festival custom with five colored silk threads tied to the arms. Later generations, it developed into many kinds of beautiful ornaments, such as long life thread, long life lock, sachet and so on. Its production is becoming more and more exquisite, becoming a unique folk art of Dragon Boat Festival.

中国传统文化中，象征五方五行的五种颜色"青、红、白、黑、黄"被视为吉祥色。端午以五色丝线系臂，曾是很流行的节俗。传到后世，即发展成如长命缕、长命锁、香包等许多种漂亮饰物，制作也日趋精致，成为端午节特有的民间艺品。
